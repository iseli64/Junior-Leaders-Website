Junior Leader officers help lead other Junior Leaders. There are six different officer positions. Each officer position does a different job at each event. 

* The president usually leads in the 4-H pledge and starts off the meeting. 

* The vice presidents sub in for the president if he or she is not there. 

* The activity planners plan fun activities for the Junior Leaders to do at meetings. 

* The historian takes pictures of Junior Leaders helping and having fun at events. 

* The treasurer keeps track of all of the money made and spent for Junior Leaders.
