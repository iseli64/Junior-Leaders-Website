Reward System

Junior Leaders isn't just about helping the community, it's also about having fun! To make sure Junior Leaders have fun, there is a point system. You can get points by helping in different ways. Junior Leaders can get points from going to Junior Leader events. If Junior Leaders get 100 points, they get to go on a completion trip and get to spend a day having fun and hanging out with their friends. Junior Leaders get to go to fun places and eat out for either lunch or dinner. This year, the Junior Leaders went to Top Golf, Climb Time, and a Japanese restaurant for dinner.
